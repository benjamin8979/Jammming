# Jammming

The Jammming App uses the Spotify API to allow a user to create their own custom playlist and save it to their Spotify account. 

## Usage

If this is your first time using Jammming, you will be redirected to Spotify and asked to allow Jammming to connect to your Spotify account. Once you are connected, you can search for tracks to include in your playlist by song name, artist, or album using the searchbar. The search results will be displayed in the Results section where you can choose which tracks to add to your playlist by clicking the add button next to the track. Once a track is added, it will appear in the Playlist section. As soon as you have added at least one track and named your playlist, you can click the "Save to Spotify" button and your playlist will appear in your Spotify account!

## Important Note

You must set the clientID variable on line 6 of src/Utilities/Spotify.js to your own personal Spotify clientID to able to connect to your Spotify account. Visit https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api for more information on retrieving your Spotify client_id.
